<!-- 
Create an HTML page with a simple counter
Create a simple up-down counter
Add two buttons “+”, and “-”
Based on the button clicked, update the value displayed.

Make sure the <div> that renderts the counter value has an id of counter-value
Make sure the “+” button has an id of increment
Make sure the “-” button has an id of decrement

The IDs should match or else the tests will fail.

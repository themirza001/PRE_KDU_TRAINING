/*
  Create a utility function findById that takes an array of User objects and a number as arguments and returns a User | undefined (if the user with the given ID exists).
  Extend the function to support a new parameter, which specifies if the returned user should include undefined or throw an error. Use TypeScript's never type to represent the error-throwing case.
  Test the function using a sample array of User objects and handle both scenarios (with and without throwing an error).

  Export the function findById so that it can be used in the test file.
